# Nexus Webapp (App-Second)

This is a small React + Vite scaffold to mirror the website-first Nexus OS experience in an app-second environment. It provides routes for all 26 systems and a compact UI shell.

Quick start

PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Matth\Documents\trae_projects\VirtuaCity Nexus\webapp"
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Notes

- This is a lightweight prototype: expand components, add state management, and connect APIs as needed.
- The `/src/data/systems.js` file contains the 26 system definitions used to generate routes.
